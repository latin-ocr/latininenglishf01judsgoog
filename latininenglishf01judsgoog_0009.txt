Panisos.

Ι —um—

Tnuan is no royal road to learning3 and this book
is by no means intended even as a “short out” to a .
complete knowledge of Latin. But it is the belief of
the writer that it is possible to get definite value from

knowing some Latin, even if one is unable to know
much Latin; and that it would be a saving of time
and energy to have selected for one just the portion
whioh would have the most immediate utility.

There ars many studente in our high sohools and
academies who do not study Latin at all. But with
tha most of these it is an object to get as thorough an
acquaintance as may be with the English language‚
and for this purpose thera are made a number of
works on the analysis of words. All such books, how-
ever, have virtually to ignore the faot of the oom-
posite souroe of English. The mere assertion that a
given root or suffix is of Latin or Greek origin means

> very little to the student. And a knowledge of deriv-

atives gained in this way is usually quite meohanioal
and narrow.

It is the theory of the present work that the deri·
vation of English words from Latin cannot be well

understood by one who is ignorant of that language.
