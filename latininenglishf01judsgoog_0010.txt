Of course, much knowledge would be desirable; but ·
in fact, as has been said, for a large proportion of our
high school students that is out of the question. Is

it, then, possible to get so much acquaintance· with
Latin etymology, with the peculiar methods of inflec-
tion and of the compositiones words in that tongue,
and to acquire such a vocabulary as to make the Latin
‘ derivation of English words intelligihle, and at the
same time not to spend more than an ordinary school

year in the process? This book is an attempt to
’ answer that question in the affirmative.

There is a further purpose. The decision that a boy
or girl shall or shall not study Latin is often made at
an early age and without very mature consideration;
and not infrequently when too late the student regrets
anegative decision. By taking up this work it is possi-
ble to spend a year in studying the English language,
and at the sometime to get such a start in Latin that
if then desired it will be easy to go on. Thus the
important decision in question may he deferred a year,
and finally made more intelligently.

These two purposes the author has attempted to

carry out, -with what success can only be seen when
the book has had the test of the schoolroom.
