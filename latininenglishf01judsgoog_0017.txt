Ir one examines the words in au English dictionem,

“ it will he seen that many of them are horrowed from

other languages. “Wigwaffl is from au American
Indian dialect. The early settlers in Massaohusetts
had no word of their own to indicate the rude struet
ure in whioh the savages were sheltered, and so tried
to imitate the Indian namo. “ Lasso '’ is a Spanish
word, learned by the huuters and oowboys from the
Mexioans. “ Depot'' we have taken from the Frenoh
as a convenient term to denote a plaoe for storage. -
Itis frequently used in the United States as applied
to a railway station, although it is not so appropriate
in that sense as the word “station'' “Aquiline” is
from the Latin word “ aquila,’' whioh means an eagle;
an aquiline nose is one ourved like au eagle's beak.
And so we might easily find words taken from a
variety of other languages,-German‚ Turhish‚ Por·
tuguese, Russian‚ chinese Dutoh, and many more.
Other languages borrow foreign words, but English
is peculiar in the faot that it has so many. In laet, a
deoided majority of the words in one of our diution-

aries are not English in their origin. Authors differ
