IN TRODUOTION. XV

It will be seen that diction, dotato, dmtotioo, indict,
predict, predicate, for instance, hare the root die. One
who is familiar with Latin recognizes dic as the root
of a Latin verb meaning “ to say.’' So it ie plain that
all these English words must hare some meaning
connected with “ saying.” And a moment’s reflection
will show this to be correct. The other syllables in
these words are also Latin, each with a meaning easily
understood by the Latin scholar. ‚
Surely an intelligent knowledge of the language we
use is a raluable thing to have. But this large ele-
ment of the language which comes from the Latin
cannot be understood unless one knows something
of that language. How much must one know? Of

¹ course if it is possible to study Latinior years, so as

to know very much about it, it will be so much the
better. But if that cannot he done, it is at least
possible to become familar with Latin modes of inflee
tion and derivation, and to leam anumber of the more ·
ν ordinary Latin words. In this way a flood of light is
poured on the meaning of alarge part of our English

speech,
