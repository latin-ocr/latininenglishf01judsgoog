3. What the Romans canon the quantity ol aa ·· Is un-
known in English. We distinguish between different sounds oi
the same vowel, as oi a in itote, tot, sother, all. But we pay
no attention to the relative time it takes to make these various
sounds.

The Romans, however, gave one, and only one, sound to
any vowel. The Latin a, ior instance, had always the sound
oi the English a in ,tethea But this one sound oi a vowel
they made in two ways: either protracting it, thus making it
long, or clipping it off, thus making it short. This distinction
as to the length oi time taken in sounding a vowel they called
quantity.

The quantity oi a vowel, then, is the relative time taken in
sounding it.

With reference to quantity,vowels are either long or short
A long vowel should take twice the time oi a short vowel.

In printing, quantity is indicated hy a mark over the vowel ;
eg. long a is printed d, and short a, ἄ. A vowel which may be
either long or short is called common, and hae both marks;
ep. ἔ.

4. The remaining letters of the alphabet are conson
nanis (consonantes, souadinp with).

Their souuds can be made only with vowel sounds.

The consonante in Latin have the same sound as in
English, with the following exceptions:

o and g are always hard (ie. c as in cot, g as in yos).

1· has the sound of y, andr nearly that oi w.

sis always sharp (as in son ; never like e in windam).

b before s has the sound of p.

a has the sound of ds (or perhaps of sd).

a is not really a Latin letter. The Romans horrowed it from
Greek.
