Articulate sounds are made by a current 01 air (the breath)

which passes from the lungs through the vocal cords and is
modified by the palate, tongue‚ 10011, and lips.
· ιι 10 called the epea vowel, because in 'sounding it the J'aws
and lips are wide open. lt wdl be seen that 0 101100 sounded
by partially elosing the Jews, and 1 by more nearly closing
them; 0 by partially closing the lips, and ιι by almost closing
them. Hence 1 and ιι are called close vowels‚ and 0 and 0
mediol vowels. ybas the sound 011, with the lips beldin
position to sound ιι, -like 0 10 French or ii in German.

Again, in sounding ιι, 0, 1, 110 breath is thrown against
successive parts 01 110 palate. Hence these vowels are called
palotal. In sounding o and u the breath is thrown out directly
through the lips. Hence these vowels are called labial (from
the Latin labium, lip).

By continuing the successive contractiori oi the vocal organa,
the 0000000010 are ‚formed in the order 01 110 table until the
surd mutes are reached.

In sounding the consonante the breath is modified‚ as has
been said, by one or more 01 110 parts 01110 mouth. These
that result irom throwing the breath against the palate are
called palatala These in making which the tongue is espe-
cially active ara called linguate (lingua, 100000). These whose
sound is formed by the use oi either (or both) 01 110 lips are
called labiola (labium, lip).

The 000001 consonants (sonans, 0011οἀ100) are made by
expelling the breath ioreibly.

10 110 surde (surdus, 001 heard) the breath is emittcd
quietly.

The 0001000010, j (= y in English) and v (= te in English),
are merely thc vowels 1 and u used to begin a syllable; eg.
ejus, voni. Thus the close vowels can hardly be distinguished
from the most open consonante. Indead, in many Latin texts
the forms j and v never occur, 1 and ιι being always written.
