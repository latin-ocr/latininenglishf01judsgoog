14. The quantity oi a syllable is the relative time
tahon in prououneing it.

Syllables are either lony or short. A long syllable
takes longer time to pronounee than does a short one.

A long vowel is supposed to take about twice as long to
pronounoe ssdoes a short one. 'Ihe relative length of syllables
must be less exact, as there is no uniformity in the number of
articulations they may nnumin. 'l'he more letters in a syllable,
the longer it will take to sound it (there are no silent letters iu
Latin, 12).

still, one long syllable is eonsldered about equal to two short
ones.
