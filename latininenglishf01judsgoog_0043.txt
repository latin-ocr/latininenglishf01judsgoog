afflabat, which originally meant to wind orte cofety; pec-

occurs in pedat and protectricem· custod· is about the

same as cwstody,· land- is made into a verb, as land,

and is found in the noun teodotion and in the adjective
tornantem. Ρόᾱ- is seen in pedat and pedestrion.

2. It will be seen that many English words in which

these Latin stems appear have other letters or sylla·

' bles. Some of these are English. Others are Latin3

such aword as teudotion, for instance, coming direotly

from a Latin noun stem, laudation, which is itself ulti-

mately derived from the stem land. The rnethod hy

which these derivatives are formed, and the force of

the various syllables, will be explained later. All that

is necessary now is to notice the English words in

which the Latin sterns occur, and the similarity in

meamng.
