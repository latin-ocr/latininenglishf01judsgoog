39. The noun stems thus far studied are masculine
or feminine. Neuters are somewhat different in their
inflection.

It has been seen that maseuline and feminine liquid
stems take no ending in the nominative singular. A
neuter stem ending in a oonsonant we shall find takes
no ease ending either in the nominative or in the
aecusative singular. And in those cases in the plural,
neuters take the ending a (or fa) instead of es.

In the rest of the cases neuter stems take the same
endings as masculine and feminine stems.

Thus the table of endings for neuter consonant ,
stems is as follows:

Snooun Tanna or Eunnros.
δίκᾳ. Plur.

l.. I} ‘o 1³>

G. Is dm (or iiim)

liz} ’ 1¹³³*

In the inflection, final t preceded by a is dropped.
