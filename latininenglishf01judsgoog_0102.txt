⁷8. A Roman man usually had three names. The
first neme (praenomen), as with ue, was his personui
name (which was often represented by its initial).
The second name (noman) was the name of his tribe.

The third name (cognomen) was the name of his
family. Thus Publilio cornelius scipio belonged to
the Scipio family of the Oorwelion tribe, and his indi-
vidua] name was Publius.

Sometimes a fourth neme (agnomen) was added
to denote some personal quality or exploit. Thus
Publius Cornelius Scipio Afrlcinns had won military
renown in Africa.

A Roman woman usually had only the name of the
tribe, as cornelia. A younger sister was denoted by a
numeral, as Cornelia Sdcunda, Cornelia werna.
