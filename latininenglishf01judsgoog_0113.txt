84. Verb stems ending in a short vowel (ὅ, ὲ) form
siens, and are inflected in general like stems in a long
vowel.

’ Α short vowel, however, is so easily lost or changed,
that some apparent differences occur.

In the perfect stem the vowel is lost, and the stem sufflxv
becomes n.

Verb stem mone, perfect stem monn· (lor moneo)
‘⁴ sona, “ nonli- (fornoum)

In the supine stem the short vowel becomes 1.

Verb stem mone, supine stem moult· (for moneo)
‘⁶ soni, “ scult- (soruonib)

The inflection oi stems in ὅ and e is like that of
stems in ὀ and ἰ.
