An examination of these examples will-show that
there are three general ways in which the change is
made: (1) By a prelix. (2) By a change in the body
of the verb stem. (3) By a suffix.

1. The only prefix used is the reduplicatiou. This
consiste of the initial consonant followed by l or ὅ.
Thus gen· gives gigen- (the ὅ being dropped for con·
venicnce of enunciation).

2. The change in the body of the stem may consist
‘in the lengthening of avowel. Thus duc gives duc.
It frequently consists in the insertion of a nasal (m
before a labial, otherwise n). Thus run, cub-‚v10-,
frag, fud, yield the present stems rump, cumb, vinc,
hang, fund. Sometimes the stem vowel and the ¹
final consonant change places: sper· becomes epra.

3. The suffix may be n. Thus from tem comes
temn·. The suffix may be -sc·.' Thus from iri- comes
irasc. The suffix may be t. Thus plec- gives plect.
The suffix may be a vowel, as in the last four exam-
ples‚eap1-‚ sanci, vide, juvia

The stem ges changes to ger· merely because in the
inflection of the present stem e would always come
between two vowels (38).
