might have a stem carp- or carpi„ statud might have
statii- or statut, ωδ might have am· or amb. And one

give the perfect stem. And the perfect participle will always
give the supine stem.

These four forms are called the raracmsn rinus of a Latin
verb. Hereafter they will he given, the student being left to
find the stems from them.

English verbal (or participial) noun in city: carpen-

The stem of the gerundis formed by attaching the
ending endo· to the present stem oi the verb.

The stem isinflected only in the singular number, andis

The connecting vowel ὅ of this ending is absorbed by the
stem vowel d or h of the present stem.
