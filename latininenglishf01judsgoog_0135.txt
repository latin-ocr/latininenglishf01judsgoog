i. It will be noticed that the inflection of slim differs in
some particulare from that- ol other verbs. Thai is doubtless
ior the reason that slim is much more ancient than other verbe,
and keeps the very old forms ol inflection.

In these old forms, the only connecting vowel ln the present
indicative was n, used before a nasal (m, n).

The present stem is ds· (compare the English is). In the
present tense the radical vowel ὅ was dropped whonever a
connecting vowel was used. Hence the indicative forms are
readily explained:

ali-m cii-mita
,δι ea tls
. οι- t arr-nt

In the present subiunctive the cld connecting vowel was i.
Hence the forms oi snm are (the radical vowel dropped, as

above) ἴ al-tn s-i-nriin

sic aitis
att crat
