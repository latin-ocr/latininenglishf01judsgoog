and sdm. Wherever the radical vowel of ds- is dropped, the
t of pot- is assimilated to the following s. Hence the inflection
is, in the present indicative, possum, potes, potest, posed-
miis, potestis, possunt. The present subjunctive is possim,
possis, etc. The other tenses, poterim, potere, in the indie-
ative, have no change. The imperfect subjunctive possem,
and the present infinitivo posse, show the assimilation oft to s.

In the tenses formed from the perfect stem, fin fd· disap-
pears after t: potui, potuerim, etc.

3. 1616, Ι beor, stem fer, is another verb which shows traces
of the old form of inflection without a connecting vowel before
r, s, t. In the present indicative the first person uses the same
vowels as other consonant stems. Thus the inflection of that
tense in the active 111ίό18,1111-11,1111-1, 1611111111,1ο11-111, ferunt5
in the passive, feror, fer-ris, fer-thr, fdrlmhr, ferimini, fe-
runtdr. The imperative active is: present, 161, fer-td, future,
fer-te, fer-td, fer-toth, idnmto. And the passive: present,
fer-16‚f611m1ni; future, fer-thr, fer-thr, fer-nntdr. The pres-
ent imperative active is ferro, and the passive fer-ri.

Like edm, ferd uses a stem from an entirely distinct root as
a perfect stem — tm. The perfect is tiill, eto.

The supine stem is from a third root—lat. In point of
fact these three stems happen to have the same meaning, and
so are joined in inflection. The principal parts are 1616, ferre,
tun, letne. Several verbs form the principal parts in this way
from different roots. For convenience we call these the parts
of one and the same verb. Of course lero, tnn, latiis, are
really quite different words, rather than different forms oi tho
same word (as is the case with carpo, carpsi, carptus).

4. volo, Iam 1111ῑὶ119, and its compounds 11618 and 111516,
also retain traces of the older form of inflection.

The stem of volo is vbi, the radioal vowel also appearing
assandi.

In the present indicative the inflection is 11618, vis, vult,
voldmiis, vultis, volunt. The radical vowel is wealrened to
u when the connecting vowel is omitted, though in older Latin
