stem are nomina, the perfect stem ceminio, and the
supine stem neminie.

It at once appears that the stem nomm- is formed
from the root ne by adding the suffix ·m1n·; the various
stcms of nosco by attaching to the same root (which
is the same as the verb stem) the suffixos -sc, -v-, and
-τις and the stem of nobilis by attaching to no the
suffix -bm-. All these stems, then, are formed directly
from the root.

But the verb stem admini- is evidently formed
from the noun stem nomin· by attaching the vowel ἱ.

Stems‚ then, we infer, are formed directly from roots
cr directly from other stems‚ in each case by attaching
suffixes. '

Stems formed directly from rocts, like nomin, are
called Parmanr srnms. Stems formed from other
stema, like nomini„ are called sncovnsav srnms.

110. Let us look at a few other nouns: praenomen,
first adme (literally, sore name); cognomen, lod acme
(literally, with name); agnomen, added acme.

We see that all of these have the same stem,
nomin, but differ in the prefix. ·

We see also that these prefixes are all prepositions:
prae, before ; co (= edm), with (the g in cognden we
should find on careful study to he a part of the older
form of the stem grimm, from the older form of the
root, gno->3 ad· (123), to (de. anama attached to a
name = an added name).

PrepesitionS‚ with some sort of adverbia] sense,
usually, are commonly used as prefixes.
