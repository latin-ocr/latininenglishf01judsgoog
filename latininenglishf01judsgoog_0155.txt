Resides those in the list (123), there are some prep
ositions which are used only as prcfixes: amb1‚amb‚
arcuad; dle, di, 00000100, apum ln, 001 (= the English
00); por, toward ‚· re, red, bock; ιδ, ned, 001010, 00001,
νδ, aot.

Not infrequently a verb with a prefix shows a
change 01 its radical vowel: tenet, I hold; oontlnell, I
hold together Here the short e becomes short 1 The
same change is often made with short a: habeo, I 10000 ,·
adhibeo, I hacc to myreis, ic. I 10100, or adopt. The
diphthong ae, in like manner, becomes i: caedo, I
cut; incido, 10011010. The diphthong au becomes fi:
claudo, I closc; includo, idoneitate, Ι include.

111. Let us look at another set 01 nouns: respublica,
00000110, agrlcultsua, 0901001000, 1301οό16010 00100001·
and the adjective magnanlmus, 00001 scaled.

We see at once that each 01 these consists 01 two
separate words joined together, neither being a mere
preposition. Respubllca = the noun res, ming, -Ι- the
adjective publiea, public; agricultura = the noun stem
agro (ὅ changed to 1), field, -Ι- the noun cultura, cul
11001100, rgn106161=the noun stem lgm, fire, -Ι- the
noun color, 00100, magnanimus = the adjective stem
magno, 90001, -l- the noun animus, cccl.

We notice also: (1) That the first part is usually a
stem (it would be in respublica, except that that word
is often written as two-res pubuca); (2) that the
stem vowel before a consonant appears as 1 (agre, in-
stead 01 0510), (3) that the stem vowel before another
vowel is dropped (magn instead 01 magno).
