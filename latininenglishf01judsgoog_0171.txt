of a noun, just as if there were a verb with that stem:

7. English words are formed direotly from the stems
of nearly all oi these Latin derivative nouns.

1) Very often the English merely uses the Latin
nude stem. Sometimes a short vowel in the penult

of the stem is out out, and often the English word ’

is spelled with a final silent e. Thus we have circle
irorn circulo, globulo from globulo, scnrple from serd-
plssri, capsula from oapsdld, appetite from appetiti,
oblivion from oblivion, ardor from ardon, argument
irom argumento, receptorio irom receptiomo, opertere
from apertura.

2) When the nude stem ends in 1, this is usually
spelled y in English. Thus we have aetery irom
notario, aetery from imarii, sollooy irorn fallicld.
From sumasne, however, we have calendar, instead
