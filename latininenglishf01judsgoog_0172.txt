01 colendam, as if making a second nude stem by
dropping 1. 00000101 10 formed in the same way from
eoncordia. Usarp, 110111 fianta, is formed as if from
a stem in 111.

3) Α nude stem ending in ·t1· has a different change
in English. -t- becomes e. 1 is sometimes written y,
as in deinenoy, 110111 clementia, but is usually dropped,
a silent e being written after the c (thus giving 0 the
sound 01 s), as in oporice, from avaritid.

This 0001110 because these words come tous through the
French. But French originally was only a sort 01 colloquial
Latin, such as was spoken by people who could neither read
nor write. 010011100111011,1110)1 made many changes 111 their
ways oi prououncing Latin words. And among these changes
was the slipping in oi an s-sound aiter t in final syllables oi
stems: thus, the Latin nude stem clementi, 01 clementii,
mercisulaess‚ became clementel. But t before s is not easy
to pronounee, and scon dropped away, leaving the word cle·
’ mensi (spelled in Frcnch clemencie). We use this French ,
word, spelling it clemency (y being the customary English
equivalent oi Erench ie— as in 11011, 101 the Ercnch 110110).

4) Stems in -tat, when used as an English word,
lost the final t, y being written instead oi a. Thus we
have affinity, from affininit.

This change is also due to the Erenoh,-the Latin stem 4

afflnItat beccming the Erench 01111111, which we use with the
spelling affinity.

5) Stems in -tudln- also lose the last· two letters in
English, silent e being written at the end. Thus we
have lassitude from luntrium, latiiade from laturiam.
This is really the nominative form lassitudd treated
as a stem (see 134).
