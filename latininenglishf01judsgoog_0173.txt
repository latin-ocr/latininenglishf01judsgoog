6) Several words in the Latin nominative are used
without change as English words: calculus, modulus,
formula, odium, praemium, abddmen, speolmen, vincli-
lum, and others.

Α calculus is a pebhle, and is used in medicine as the
technical name for a little stone sometimes secreted in
some parts ol the body, for example, in the bladder.
But as pebbles were anciently used in rechoning (just
as children and savages even now use their fingers),
calemus cane to mean any method of computation,
and so is used now as the name of certain branches
ol mathematice. It is from the word in this sense
that we have the words calculata, calendatica. A wln-
ouldm is something used to diod—a houd. The word
is used. in algebra of a sign which binds together
several expressions. '
