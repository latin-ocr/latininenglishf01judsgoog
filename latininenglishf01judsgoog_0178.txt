(e'e. the stem without its vowel). Α slight change in

spelling the final syllable is common3 ey. the nude
stem of copiosos, full os chondcnce, is coptos, which
in English becomes eopiccs. vathos, foll cf words,
we spell verbose. 'The letter seems the more natural
way of spelling the word, as the final e is so com-
monly used in English, especially when we wish to
show that the preceding vowel has not its short sound5
ey. lietberte. But the suffix cce, used instead of ose,
is explained by the fact that the words in which it
occurs corne to us not directly from the Latin, but
from a French word which itself was derived from
the Latin. The words in ose, on the other hand, come
directly from the Latin. In this way we see st once
the history of such words as genereus, jocose, perrel»
ciens, odiens.

2. When the nude stem ends in two consonants, we
do not need to change the spelling. Thus we have
just, peditent, fraudulent (see the endings).

3. The Latin suffix -b111-‚ when mode nude, becomes
-bu·. We do not pronounce the 1, and so have dropped
it out, a silent e being added. Hence we have offoble,
ewrihle, and the like.
