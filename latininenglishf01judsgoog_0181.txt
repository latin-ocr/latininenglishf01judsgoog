English words are made from Latin verb stems in
various ways.

1. Sometimes the verb stem (nude) cr the present
stem (nude) is used without change (145, 2): corp,
from carpere, ιο ac'hble, ιο ploelc,· dorca, from damnare,
ιο condoma· cede, from cedere, ιο yield (here the silent
eis added).

2. We recognize not a few English words which
are Latin present participle stems (145, 3): agent,
from agere, ιο do; radicat, from radiare, ιο shoot
coya· crescent, from crescere, ιο grew. The meaning
of these words is plain. An egeat is one who does
something, sometimes acting for another person. We
call a person's face radicet when it seems to shine
with joy. And the moon is crescent when it is new
(te. when it is just growing larger).

3. The supine stems of verbs we find in a large
number oi English words (145, 1). The student will
sce the meaning of the following words, in which
appear supine stems of verbs cited in Study XXXI.:
ιοοοοιιοιιοο, ruptore, oct, merset, capture, cision, coto
tion, locutios, locate, morcincto, oration, agitaltes.

There are swarms of English words in οιο and οιίοιι which
come from Latin supine stcms. These will be given in Part IV.
