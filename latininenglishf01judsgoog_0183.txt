or a proposition in an adverbial sense), while the
second part is the stem of an inflected word

122. When the stems of inflected words ere put
together, there are apt to be some phonetic changes:
magno -l- animo ι- s = magnimos, greotsooled. Tho
stem vowel δ in the first part is lost before a vowel:
agroe— cola: agricole, ο former. The stem vowel ὅ
becomes 1.

We saw in tubicen thet the stem of the first part
was tuba, the ι being changed to 1. This is a very
common change in forming compounds. And 1 is even
added to a consonant stem: pic, peace, ÷ss0‚ melec,
¹ :pacificus pcoccoaolea'oy.

Also in tubicen we see that the root vowel e in the
second part becomes ὅ. This also is common—h or
ὅ becoming 1, ae (as in inmaidi) becoming i, au be
coming ὃ or ῦ. ι sometimes becomes e or n.

The first partos a oompound word is often a per-
ticle (101). But many particles end in a consonent.
And if the second part of the compound begins with
a consonent, there is usually a phonetio change. Thus,
ln, oyoiost, † pugnare, ιο fight, = impugnare, ιο ytyht
against. Here the linguel n becomes the correspond-
ing labial m (5) before the labie] p (by pronouncing
inpugnare and impugnare the student will see how
much eesier the latter is). This change is called por·
tiol assimilatioa.

An example of complete ossimdotioa is irridere, ιο
looyb οι, compounded of 1n ι- ridere. In this word n
is changed to the seme letter es that following
