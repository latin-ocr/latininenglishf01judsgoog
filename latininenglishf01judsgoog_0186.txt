Latin eomponnds are used in great numbers as Eng-
lish words. They ean be properly explained, however,
only as Latin words. To attempt the analysis of suoh
an English word by resolving it at oneo into its parts
is merely to put the cart before the horse. Sometimes
studente are taught, for instance, that totermmtion oon-
sists of the prefix teter, meaning between, the root rap,
ιο break, and the suffix tion, meaning aaa σοι. In truth,
however, interemptione is merely the stem of the Latin
noun interruptio. The stem is a eompound of the
preposition inter and the noun stem ruption. The last
is eomposed of the supine stem mpe(fr01n the verb
stem rep) ÷ the suffix -ibn, whieh denotes the oet
(117, 1).

Benefoetor is obviously the noun denoting the agent
(117, 2), from οόοόιᾰοέτὸ, ιο (ιο qood, as malefactoris
from malefacere ο do ill, and satisfactione from sauma-
cere, ιο do οιιοοιᾳιι.

From magnanimus, preat soolert, we have magnaei

moue, impugnare, tofiyht epotaret, gives us tmpuyn.
The former word is merely the Latin nominative, with

the last syllable adepted to our way of spelling. We
are not aooustomed to end words in the syllable -as,
—we write mertone, speetous, tortuosis, οοοιοοο (136).
Imperare is the nude stem of the Latin verb, unohanged.
This nude stem oi a Latin verb (with or without silent
e final) we find also in the words obseoacl, manime,
deduce, interverto, postpone. Their meaning is found
in the examples (145).
