ras] ronunrrou or courooun ueros. 167

If we look ab another oompound Latin verb, accl-
pere, to receive, we see that the English derivative is
accord (145, 6c). Here plainly the supine siem, in-
stead of the nude present siem, is taken, but with
exaotly the same meaning. N otice circumvent, ecorc
erate, immiqroie, oppress (from opprimere), prohibit,
subditicio, truacoresc.

§adirigas (siem saxifragd), stoue doching, is con·
verted into the English soccfroge, by using the nude
stem with final e silent. The saxifraga is a delicate
plant which derives its name, as some say, because it
grows in erevices of the rocks3 more probably because
it was once thought that if taken as a medicine it
would break up a stone in the bladder.
