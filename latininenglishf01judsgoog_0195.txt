The other words are in common use. Krioa in Latin .
means cond. But the place in the amphitheatro
where the gladiatore fought was covered with saud,
'so that they would not slip. For that reason the place
came to be called the cond, arena. And the word we
use for any similar place. Thon it has a figurative
meaning, applied to any place of contest3 as when we
call Congress the areca of national politios.

photographs was called, when it was invented and

Cornea is the feminine of the adjective comens,
mode of bora, derived from the stem of the noun cornu,
bora. We apply the word to the hard and transparent
window of the eyeball. The feminine is used perhaps
because it means pars cornea, the howry part.
