captured a number of ships from the fleet ol the enemy,
and fastened the prows to a column in the great public
square in Rome. Near this column was placed the
platfcrm in which public speakers stood. And so
that platform came to be called thorosus. From that
usage we have learned to call such a platform a
rostrum.

It will be noticed that rostrum comes from the stem
rod· of rodere, ιο pocus, ιο pech, with the suffix -trum
(stem tro, 117, 3), denoting the irrstrumeut. So a
rostrum was the instrument with which a bird pecks.
