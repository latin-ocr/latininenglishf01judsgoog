been explained, this was the form which would be
incessantly heard in conversation, and so it would he
natural to use this and to drop off the suffixes of inflec-
tion which were peculiar to the Latin grammar.

Thus the nude stem of nod, a chen, is are, which
πθ write nrlc,· 0011! gives ns cell, columne, column.

verbnm (stem verbe), nond, gives us verb (te. the
word, the most important word, in a sentence).

In like manner come ancien (from acchon, increnc
inp), benefactor (from benefactor, well doec), sont (from

lonc, N. lons, n sonntcin). The adjectives augustns Ὺ

and §quatiens give us anpnst and aquatic. From al.»
sssndere, to hide away, comes nhncccd, and advertere,
to torn to, gives us adven.

142. In writing these stems as English words πθ
sometimes make slight changes in spelling. For in-
stance, the nude stem of nea, n chen, we write erle,
which is conveniently different from the nude stem of
archs, n bow, which πθ write ccc. ι

1. One of the changes is the addition to the nude
stem oi a silent e. Thus πθ write recline, from reoli-
nere, to leon baclo, probe, from probare, to proce ,· cede,
from cedere, to pield ,· captiae, from captivus oprieoner,·
convince, from convincere, tc conquer. This e is not
sounded, and its nse is to show that the next preceding
vowel is long (probe, not prob), er that a preceding
c or p should have the soit sonnd (concinne, we pro
nounce convince, not concine). It is also added when
the word otherwise would end in a mute and aliquid

-nnicnble
