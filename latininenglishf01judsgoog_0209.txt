2. Another change consists in dropping out 1 (and
sometimes ὅ or n) in a suffix between a mute and a
liquid. The nude stem of efficabssls, friendly (stem
amicabili-y is amicabile We drop out 1 between b and
t and write the stem cmicoble-adding the silent e.

3. When the nude stem ends in a doubled consonant,
we usually drop one, unless the accent falls on the
final syllable. Thus deterrere, to friphtea from, gives
detcr, instead of detera· but we write odd, nell, still.

English. Pulmoneum, belocyiup to tte lueys, gives
pulmonem, instead of pulmoecw7; ltpldfflue, o stoue
ceder, gives lepidum evlirlnm, a place to keep birds
(11⁷, 5), gives aetery. But sometimes 1 is dropped
instead of being w‘rstten as y: capitol, from capitonem.

We also use ty instead of final tat in nude stems
of nouns: levitae (N. levites), liphtocsc, we write
rete·

perhaps originally from mere carelessness.

The first word in the Latin version of the ereed

believe. The nude stem is cred, which we should
expect to find written crede. At an early period it
was written in that way, the silent e at the end show·
ing that the other e was long. But somehow we have
come to indicate that long sound by doubling the e,
writing creed instead of crede.

Bou, the neme of a shrub, or trec, comes from buxa
Fama is fiom firma3 forle from fruct.

rho nude stem diso, from disces, a platter, o plote,
