Stems in -mln- (forming the N. in men, 117, 3), -dln-
and -glu- (N. dd, -gb, 134)Ι are not usually transferred
to English. The nominative singular, which is quite
unlike the stem, and was a case form very much used,
and hence one which would quite often be heard, is
preferred in English. But it seems frequently to have
been treated as if it were itself a stem, the nude form
being used, with silent e final, if the preceding vowel
is long. Examples are fortitude, altitude, and others3
see134. The stem becomes an English word in mor-
yia (margin).
