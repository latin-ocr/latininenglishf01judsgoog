The Latin perfect participle was regularly used by tha
Romans as an adjective. In this sense' the nude stem of the
participle, which is the same as the supine stem, was originally
horrowed by the English. For instance, the supine stem of
crem, to neate, is creat. And in an English poem of the
fourteenth century we find the author (Chaucer) saying ‘⁶ God
bath creat all things,” which is evidently equivalent to “hath
created'’ But in order to he sure that there could be no mis-
take about the meaning, people began to attach our past parti·
ciple suffix -ed to the Latin stem, thus making created. And as
that at once suggested averb create, it was not long until that
cameto be used. Also, see Skeat’s Etymological Dictionary‚
under abbreviata. But these supine ¹sterne we sometimes use
as adjectivae: desecet, correct, object.

2. The present stem oi many Latin verbs is also
used as an English word, usually a verb. Thusfrom
οόᾱότό, to yield, we have cede.

3. The stem oi the present participle is sometimes
- used as an English adjective or noun. Thus from
agere, to do, we have egeat, ie. one who does something3
and from nuvilare, to laisa, comes sibilant, ie. hissiap.

4. The Latin perfect stem is not used as an English
word.

stems come from consonant stems or a stems.
