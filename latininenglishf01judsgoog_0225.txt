number of words in English have been horrowed from
French. But as Erenoh is only a modified form of
Latin, it is plain that the most of these Erench·
English words can be traoed back to a Latin origin.
In fact, we find that Latin stems, more or less modi·

In many French words the Latin nude stem has
not been changed at all. Then in taking such words
into English, they will appear exactly as if they had
been horrowed direotly from Latin. For instance,
our word cessioa is just the same in spelling and in
meaning as the Erench word cecoton. of course, there
is a difference in the pronunciation. But it is ve1y
plain that cessino is merely the Latin stem cession-
(N. cessio), which means o pieldiup, being a noun
denotingtheoct(117,1), formed by adding the suffix
don· to the supine stem cese· of ceddre, to yield. The
Erench used the stem unchanged, and as the Erenoh
word came to be used by the English, they had in

cecoton from the Erench, and not direotly from the
Latin? Merely because we find that the word was
used in Erench books before it was in English-that
