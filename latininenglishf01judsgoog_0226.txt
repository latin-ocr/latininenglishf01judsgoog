it was commonly used by the French with whom the
English were familiar-and that afterwards it appeared
in English books. It is merely a matter of history.

Of course this historical question as to any given
word of this class makes no difference with regard to
its meaning, or its spelling, or the Latin stem from
which it comes. Dictionaries do not always heed the
question. For example, Webster's International Dic·
tionary, under oussmrv, says: “ L. mario, fr. cedere
to give way3 cf. F. ceasioa.'' This shows the Latin
origin (although the dictionary unfortunately gives
merely the Latin nominative instead of the stem), and
points out (“ cf.'' is for the Latin confer, compare) the
Frenoh form. But it gives no notion whether the
English word came directly from the Latin, or directly
from the French. It is plain enough that the Frenoh
word must have come from the Latin. But if the
word is examined in an etymological dictionary, like
Skeat's, it will be explained quite differen ly. It will
there appear that ceraton is from the French corsica,
and the latter is from the Latin cadon, which is from
the participial stem cessus, of cedere, to picti.

However, it is not absolutely necessary that the
student atthis point should in all cases know the
historical fact as to the French origin of words which
are obviously mere Latin stems. The important thing
is to understand the Latin origin.

A few examples of these words follow, with the
Latin original, the Frenoh word which was direotly
horrowed being omitted. Often this French word did
not differ in form from the English.
