In the above list we notice examples of all the
forms of derivation from Latin nude stcms as seen in
Study XXXVII.

There are consonant stems of nouns, like cessation,
cession, oration, vowel stems ol nouns (nude)—a
stems, like sectare, from statura—1 stems, like altor,
from eltirl--o stems, like proverb, from proverbio
(N. proverblnm); the nude nominative of stems in -1n-
(37), like multitude, from muneret (stem munerun->3
adjective nude stems in 0, like derha, from benigno
(N. benignus) ;—present stems of verbs (with or with·
out final c), like decline, from detonuere, to baed aride
(or away) from-or perturb, from perturbere, to dis-
tarb; supine stems of verbs, like effect, from efficere
(affectum present participle stems, like repeat, from
regere, torale.

147. There are other words which come from the
French, which in that language have made a change
from the Latin stem, but which yet are easily recog·
nizable.

ᾗ Amoroas is from the nude stem of imotenus, sall of

loce (from amor, loce). The modern French form of
this stem is oraorear, -ec standing for the Latin ὃ.
We write oa for the French ea (which in the older
French was oa or a).
