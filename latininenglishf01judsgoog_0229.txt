Glemona ooloar, honour, laborer, are the mode oi spelling
the words in England, the oa in the last syllable showing
that they come from the Frenoh and not directly from the
Latin. In this country, however, we have formed the habit ot
writing elamor, color, bonor, labor. lt certainly is hardly
worth while to keep the a, which is entirely useless otherwise,
merely to point out the historioal fact that such words were
originally taken into English from the Frenoh. if wo are to

try to show by spelling the history oi words rather than merely
their soaads, our spelling will steadily grow even more tangled
and-ridiculous than itis.

Fatetioas is from the Freneh secatione, and that
from the Latin facetus, witty. Here the nominative
form was taken into Freneh, a being written iore
(having the same sound) as in arboreus, and ea for
the vowel. The i before ea seems to come from a oon-
fusion with the Latin noun lacenae, johas. In taking
the Frenoh word, we write oa for ea, and s for a.

We have taken many Latin adiectives direotly into English
from the nominative in-us(186), writing oas ior -ua It seems
likely that this was in imitation oi tho Frenoh change, as ex·
plained above.

Another change from the Latin stem whioh results
from our borrowing a word from the Frenoh, is seen
in beoeoolenee. The Freneh form is the same, the
Latin being benevolentia As has been explained,
