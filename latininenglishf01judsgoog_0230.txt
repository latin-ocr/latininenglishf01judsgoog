in the middle ages the Latin t earne to have the
sound ts, and after a while the t, being diffioult to
sound before a, was dropped out. This left merely
the ι sound, which the Frenoh spelled ee. The 1 was
lost, the nude stem being taken to end in ·nt›. We
have many words in ee taken thus from the Frenoh
way of spelling, although the words are often direotly
from Latin. Septenos, from the Latin sepienda, urie
dom, and somnoleaoe, from the Latin somnolentia,
sleepiuesa, earne through the Erenoh, like beneuoleooe.
So does poleos, from politium, in the same way.

Deot is aword with a silent letter, h. It was onoe
written in English detto, pronouneed just as we do
deor. It was taken into English from the old Erenoh
word delle, whioh in turn was the careless Erenoh way
of sounding the stem of the Latin (lebna, o sem owed.
After English people remembered the origin of the
Frenoh word, they earne to slip in a b, to show their
learning, and so we now write deor, although we never
sound the b. We have taken debit, however, direotly
from the Latin nude stem.

Other Erenoh changes in Latin stems are seen in
these English words: deiya from dignari, to thiale
wortby, or proper ; mountain, from mentina (a late
Latin form forment, N. mons); saint, from sanctus,
hely.

The Latin verb fecere, to mulce, had another stem
used in the passive, sr·. From this the Erenoh formed
a number oi words, and we have followed their fashion
-sometirnes adopting these Freneh words, sometimes
‚taking Latin ones, but always writing sy instead of fn.
