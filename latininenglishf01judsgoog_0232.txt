erun? xxm-comm WORDS.

149. English words of Latin origin are not merely
those which oonsist of a Latin word or the stem oi a

Latin word. It is sometimes convenient to express an l
idea by joining two Latin stems which the Romans v

never used together. Thus a bicomcrcl legislature is
one which is composed of two chambona (ag. the con-
gress of the United States consists of the Senate and
the House of Representatives). Bi is the stem of bis,
twice, and comerol is the nude stem of cameratis, an
adjective formed from the noun stem camera, o
chamber. But there is no Latin word blcamerilia.
Such words are called comico wonns. Many of
these words have an English or a Greek suffix attached

to a Latin stem: ag. demist is from the Latin stem
dent, tootlr, with the Greek suffix -iat, denoting the
one who does something implied in the stem—in
this case, one who attends to the teeth.

Examples of coined words are the following:

adverb, alluvial, ambidextrous, antedate, antedilu·
vian, binomial, calonio, candal, centennial, centrifugal,
centripetal, congenial, coordinate, coronation, coroner,
dentist, disconnect, disinfeot, dismiss, egoist, egotist‚
fac-simile, factotum, festal, fflial, forensic, grandilo
quent, horriiy, identical, illegal, illogical (and many
more with the prefix ia, meaning not), immature,
immoderate, incantation, indescribable, indestructi-
ble, indispensable, individual, indomitable, itinerant,
laboratory, legacy, linen, lingual, linguist, locomotion,
