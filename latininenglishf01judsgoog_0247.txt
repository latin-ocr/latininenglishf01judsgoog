THE GREEK IN ENGLISH. First Lessons in Greek,

with special reference to the etymology of English words ol
Greek origin. By T. D. Goonuut, Ph.D. tomo.

’ This book attempts to teach that limited portion o'l Greek which col-
lege men remember after they have forgotten vastly more. That is the
portion which even those who wish to banish the study of Greek from
our schools would admit can least easily be spared, aud that portion is
essential to a ready command of the English tongue.

The first idea of the book arose from hearing a woman of unusual in-
telligeuce and considerable reading, talking about altruists, when she
meant agnostics. Similar confusons—coufusing, ultimately, to the
speaker, and constantly to the listener—areof not infrequent occurrence
in conversation on topics interesting only to the “ educated.’' Moreover,
much as the Greek element of English appears in conversation, it ap«
pears much more in literature, and carries many of the hey-words to the
thought. He to whom these key-words are not alive with meaning is at

, great disadvantage. Many a man who thinks he has retained nothing
whatever from lris Greek, except a lively sense of the exact meaning of
such words as metaphysz'cs, agnostic,syntl1eric, anarchy, Russophobe,
nevertheless regards that sense as an intellectual acquisition worth all it
cost. But alter all, how great the cost of this one acquisition has beent
Surely this one result of the study of Greek can be reached without de-
voting to it years of time. And yet mere dictionaries or, etymological
handbooks alone cannot give what is wanted. It is not enough t0 read
or be told, even repeatedly, that syntketie is derived from such aud
such Greek words, and therefore has such and such a meaning. T lte
words in their Greek form, and with some fra ment of their Greek
assectatione, must become somewhat familiar be ore onecan be sensible
oi that grasp of their English derivatives which will enable one to use
those derivatives correctly and fearlessly.

The Greek vocabulary surviving in English can be so presented in a
sort ol Greek primer, with its relations to English so pointed out, that
even young pupils will find the study far from dull; and thus, oi just
that part of Greek which they will always use iu reading current litera·
ture, they will be apt to remember more than the much-abused
‘⁶ average college graduate.”

This book tries to accomplish these results without waste oi time and
hrain-tissuein “mental discipline'' of doubtful value. But the writer has
no faith in royal roads to learning, does not profess to havecompoundcd
an educational nostrum which will, in a few weeks’ time, electrify a boy
or girl into the masteryol a difficolt tongue‚ and does believe heartilyiu
giving an important place in our educational system, for some genera·
tions yet, to the patient and thorough study of the Greek language and
literature. This book is not intended to lessen the number of those
who shall enter upon such a course ol study, but it is hoped that it may
increase that number. Yet it is not a sufficient introduction to the
reading of a classic author, and hence is not a rival ol the various ex·
cellent ¹⁴ First Lessons” in use. Iu putting these ideas into practice the
material has been grouped about a grammatical outline, because the
thorough memorizing of a few inflections will save time and labor in
the end. by enabling tlte pupil from theoutset to makea certain limited
use of the language on rational principles. In no other waycan the re-
quisito familiarity with the Greek words be as easily gained. Besides,
