while the book is intended primarily for those who without it would
never study Greek at all, those have also been kept in mind who will
afterwards continue the study. Yet with the possible exception of the
dual number, the memorizing of which is but a trille, no feature what-
ever has been introduced which could involve labor outside of the main
purpose, as set forth above.

ΑΝ lNTRODUCTlON TO ATTlC GREEK. By anez

Bnoons, Professor in the University of Μίηηεεοῑα, 12mo.

Presents essentials in such manner that the learner may enter without
needless detention upon an intelligent and successful reading ol Attic
Greek.

The fundamental idea-that nine years’ experience in applying has
shown to be practicable—is to begin the study of Greek with a con·
nected text, and to so work this text over as to derive from it all the
grammar involved, and then to attach to the framework thus formed
whatever further grammatical apparatus is necessary. In this way the
learner’s activities are incited to discover lor himself the laws of con·
struction, and the author studled is made to appear astheir true source.

The first chapter of the Anabasis has been found to contain a stock
of words sufficiently varied to illustrate all the essential forms of the
accidence, and is accordingly taken as a basis lor work.

Conversationand dictation exerciseS, appealing to the learner's powers
of imitation, form an integral part of the plan, and, it has been found,
give him a natural and unconscious grip ol the language exceeding that
obtained by any other exercise.

GREEK LlTERATURE, By Tuouxs Sancum anxv.

8vo.

A compendious philosophical account of the growth of Greek litera·
ture and ot its relations to the physical surrountlings and political and
social history ol the people. ln this setting appear the outlines of the
great masterpieces, with English translations of their more interesting
or representative passages. The comparative method is followed, the
English reader’s familiarity with his own literature being made to help
along his acquaintance with Greek authors. lt is believed that the
college-bred man who got from his study of these classics in the origi-
nal but faint and distorted views of their beauties will here find assist-
ance in extending and organizing his knowledge3 and also that the man
who knows little or no Greek may by this book put himself in closer
contact with the spirit ol Greek literature than most students of the
language have attained.
