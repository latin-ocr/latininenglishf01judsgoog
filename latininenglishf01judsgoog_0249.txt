lt isdifficultto ascertain the reason wh the Lives ol Suetonius have
been suffered to remain solong unedited gy English-speaking scholars.
No work of equal siae that has come down to us from classical antiquity
possesses a more real interest or a more enduring value. lu the his-
torical significance oi the period that it covers, in the light it throws
upon so many points of Roman custom, and in the impartiality,
thoroughness, aud conscientious accuracy ol its author, it has always
been regarded as a most important source oi intonnation concerning
the men and mensures ol the Early Empire. It is also a rich mine oi
· personal anecdote, giving innumerable glimpses oi many famous Ro·
mans, divested oi the stage properties with which we almost always
find them in the pages oi the professione! historiaus.

Itis, then, with thehope oi gaining for the Roman Plutarchawider
circle oi appreciative readers that the present volume is given to the
public. The first two books ol the Lives have been selected because they
have todo with that period oi transition which, with its tremendous ·
moral, social‚ and political revolution, iorms perhaps the most remark·
able era oi Roman histo ς and also because their subject isthe per·
sonality oi the two greatzaesars who laid the foundation of an empire
whose influence' is still moulding the development 'oi modern Europe,
”theutinitinnuli {32³AE illiniti. c. r. nn
(Leipzi , 1886). §rme variations lrom his readrngs have been noted
and deiended in the Commentary. To obviate any reasonable ob·
Jections to Suetonius’s plainness oi speech, a lew sentences have been
relegated to the notes, but without any alteration in the original num·
bering ol the sections. These textual omissions have been made with
aspariug hand ; for experience has only served to strengthen the con·
viction oi the editor, that the application toa classic author oi any ex·
tended system ol expurgatiou is at once a moral blunder and a literary
crime.
